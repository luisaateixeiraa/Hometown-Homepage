Congratulations on your Hometown Homepage Solo Project! You did an outstanding job.

HTML

Pros:

Well-completed head section
Good indentation
Clear comments throughout the file
Proper use of heading tag sequences
Alt attributes included for all images

Potential Improvements:

Consider adding some meta tags in your head section, such as <meta charset="UTF-8"> and <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">.
Avoid repeating <h1> on line 19; use an <h2> instead. Remember, there should only be one <h1> per page.

CSS

Pros:

Good indentation
Proper use of values in selectors

Potential Improvements:

Add comments in the CSS file for better clarity.

 LAYOUT

Header:

The header currently exceeds 100vh. While the image is stunning, consider resizing it to reduce the header height accordingly. You might also want to use background-position to position the image as desired. The hero section has a significant padding-top of 420px, which places your <h1> and <h2> tags quite far from the top. I recommend reducing that padding to around 200px or less. In my opinion, the background image in the header section shouldn't exceed 40vh to allow space for additional content, like "Top Three Activities" or activity images.

Top Three Activities Section:

This section looks greatâ€”everything appears tidy and balanced! However, consider making the pictures slightly smaller for a more cohesive look.

Next Section ("Extra-Section" div):

The layout looks fantastic, but it raises a question: does this section contain "activities"? If so, it lacks a title. You have a title for "Top Three Activities," but then you present five activities without a clear distinction. Consider adding a title like "More Activities" or "Other Options" to clarify this section's purpose.

Guide Section:

Everything looks excellent here, very nice layout!

Overall, you did a fantastic job on your Solo Project, Luisa! Keep up the great work!
